# Covid 19 Tracker 

Built in January of 2022 this app is one of the first personal projects I built outside of course curriculum during my FullStack Academy Bootcamp. I built this app to help familiarize myself integrating multiple APIâ€™s into different but linked React components. The crux of this project was using google maps API to manipulate the Map object and add layers of toggleable information to that map object.  




## Tech Stack
Javascript, React, Express, ChartsJs, LeafletJS, GoogleMaps

## Future development 
Short term: Continued edge case bug fixes for non listed countries, and weird total calculator errors.  

longer term: Implement search by county for USA and add options to view historical snap-shots.
